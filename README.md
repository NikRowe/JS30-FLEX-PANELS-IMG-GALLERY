After using multiple powerful libraries such as MaterializeCSS and Material-UI, its amazing to see how simple something like this can be done with just some CSS + JS! For a little fun I added a modal using the same CSS + JS methodology. I used w3schools as a reference, they were using onClick eventHandlers but I wanted to keep it the same for fluidity so I converted.
